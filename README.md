# ShellROAS-Python-PowerBI-eMediaPatch
Showcase of how I combined Python and PowerBI on the current job in order to create the dashboard for easier tracking of ROAS performance in order to make the optimization process easier.

Python Script is combining three excel reports that are being pulled on a daily basis in order to merge them all into one and make them ready for PowerBI use.

Using separate reports in the PowerBI earlier showed frequent errors due to the many relationships between the tables.
This way everything is pre-ready and it's only needed to run the script and refresh the PowerBI dashboard, making this process more automamtized compared to how it was being done in the first version where everything had to be copied over manually.
